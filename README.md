## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **Sentiment Analysis** using the **Amazon Polarity Dataset**, which contains positive and negative product reviews. The goal is to classify reviews as positive or negative using multiple machine learning models.

---

## 🧠 Skills Applied

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Text Vectorization with TF-IDF**
- **Model Training & Evaluation**
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍  
- `pandas`, `numpy`  
- `nltk` for text preprocessing  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `wordcloud` for visualization  
- `scikit-learn` for ML models and evaluation  
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧪 Models Trained

- Logistic Regression  
- Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Random Forest Classifier  

With **GridSearchCV** applied for hyperparameter tuning.
